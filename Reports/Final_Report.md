Thoughout the development of the project, our team continued to work well together - we frequently communicated via Facebook Messanger, referred to the Kanban board for sprint deliverables and other tasks, and utilised Slack to efficiently separate discussions regarding front-end and back-end issues.

As expected, some workload overflow for these teams required the assistance of members from the other sub-teams, however this did not hinder our process in either area. If anything, it prompted us to re-evaluate design decisions and our vision for our final product, prioritising features that were more easily implemented in the limited time that we had. This can be most clearly seen in the front end, as we unanimously agreed that the back end functionality was more important, and if something in the front end was taking too long (that was not strictly necessary), then we would leave it and come back to it only if we had time to spare afterwards.

As detailed in the Management Information report, the team was split into 2 main sub-teams: back-end and front-end development. As we developed our API, we allocated additional responsibilites to different members. For example, Bailey and Nabil undertook the task of integrating the Google Trends and Twitter API with our own, as well as implementing Natural Language Processing to enable the user to create a detailed report on a certain outbreak; Harry was assigned the responsibility of implementing Machine Learning, which helped identify geographic locations in which outbreaks were detected; Estella and Jacob moved from casual debugging (i.e. simply using our website to check that everything performs as expected) to more formal API testing using Postman and writing reports based on said tests. Overall, our team member contributions were as follows:

|Name|Role|
|----|----------------|
|Bailey Ivancic|<br><ul><li>Team leader</li></ul><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask, API)</li></ul><ul><li>Web crawler and API interface</li></ul><ul><li>Natural Language Processing</li></ul><ul><li>Google Trends and Twitter API integration</li></ul><ul><li>Design Information Report</li></ul>|

|Estella Arabi|<br><ul><li>Frontend developer (React)</li></ul><ul><li>Debugger/Tester</li></ul><ul><li>Management Information Report</li></ul><ul><li>Final Report</li></ul>|

We are happy with the work that each member contributed to the project and would consider it to be an equal distribution of effort from everyone involed.
