# Management Information

### Communication and Agile Development Workflow
Our team has been working together for two years now and as such have a firm grasp on our strengths and weaknesses. In that time we have developed strategies for effective communication, delegation of responsibilities and overall workflow. We see this as a huge benefit, as knowing how the rest of the group operates aids our efficiency and workflow. This was one of the primary reason we decided to stay together as a group for this workshop.

Since we will be using **GitHub** for our project, tasks relating to functionality are posted in the *Issues* section of our repository. There is also a Kanban board in use under the *GitHub Projects* tab, that will be used for keeping track of agile sprint tasks as well as project and sprint backlogs. Other tasks relating to the reports will be written in the report document itself as a checklist. Task delegation will be handled according to our respective roles within the team, and overflow in that section will thus be delegated accordingly.

Additionally, we communicate regularly via **Facebook Messenger** to discuss our next steps and update each other on our progress. We also have weekly in-person meetings separate to our mentoring sessions which occur immediately after our mentoring timeslot, specifically Wednesday 10:20 am-12:00 pm. In this time, we work together on any tasks from the week before that have yet to be completed, and try to get a headstart on the workload for the week ahead. The meetings function as an impromptu stand-up meeting, where we are able to make sure everyone is on the same page, perform a quick demo of our current progress and clarify any questions/concerns that any members might have. 

We also take the time to collectively look at the Kanban board we have on the Github Projects page in order to see if there is a big backlog that needs attention. Other small meetings can also be held during the week, usually on a Monday or Friday, if the team feels there is a need for some extra group collaboration or there is something the group needs to work out in person.

### Roles and Responsibilities
#### Meet the team
Our team prefers to work with semi-rigid roles in place, meaning that if the overflow for a particular section of the project becomes too large, team members will be pulled off other sections to balance out the overflow workload. During normal workflows, these will be the roles assigned to each team member:

|Name|Role|
|----|----------------|
|Bailey Ivancic|<br><ul><li>Team leader</li></ul><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask)</li></ul><ul><li>Web crawler and API interface</li></ul><ul><li>Design Information Report</li></ul>|
|Nabil Shaikh|<br><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask)</li></ul><ul><li>Frontend developer (React)</ul></li>
|Harry Tang|<br><ul><li>Backend developer (Python, Flask)</li></ul><ul><li>Web crawler and API interface</ul></li><ul><li>Design Information Report</li></ul>
|Jacob Wahib|<br><ul><li>Frontend developer (React)</li></ul><ul><li>Debugger</li></ul><ul><li>Management Information Report</li></ul>|
|Estella Arabi|<br><ul><li>Frontend developer (React)</li></ul><ul><li>Debugger</li></ul><ul><li>Management Information Report</li></ul>|

#### Why These Roles?

Bailey is recognised as the team leader due to his ability to manage and organise the team and the delegation of their tasks effectively. His experience with Python and Flask from previous projects makes him an ideal member to assign the responsibility of developing the back-end for our API. As part of this responsibility, he will also work to integrate our API with our chosen web crawler, and set the foundations of our API interface - Bailey is the one that initially started working on the web crawler, and thus is the most knowledgeable of its usage. Following from this, he is therefore the best person (along with Harry) to be writing the Design Information report.

Nabil is a flexible team member with skills in both backend and frontend development. In the past, he was also a core member of the backend subteam, setting up and managing the Flask framework of our projects. However he has recently been committed to learning React, and has encouraged the team to use it in place of HTML and CSS as a frontend tool. He will thus be assigned the role of backend development, before leading the frontend development with his knowledge of React later on in the development timeline.

Harry specialises in backend development, having been part of the backend subteam for past projects as well. He is focused on the gritty details other members tend to overlook, and is committed to asking all the right questions to ensure our API performs as seamlessly as possible, adhering to the project specifications. Since he is a core backend developer, he will work with Bailey on the Design Information Report, as they are the ones who have planned and will implement the core functionality of the API, thus knowing how it will work best.

Jacob has been known to switch between frontend and backend subteams depending on need and circumstance, however he leans towards the front-end based on preference. As such, he will assist Estella in the design of the project website interface, balancing this with the writing and maintenance of any and all reports required. He is also thorough in his testing methods and is often the one who reports bugs within the project if he cannot resolve them himself.

Estellaâ€™s development preferences lie within the visual design of the project and is adept at cleaning up the basic template started by the backend team into a user friendly interface. For this reason she has been assigned the role of the frontend developer and report writer. Since she will be spending a lot of time using the website, it is inevitable that she will encounter bugs regarding its performance, and consequently report them to the backend subteam if she cannot fix them herself
