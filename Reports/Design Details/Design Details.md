# Design Details Report

### 1. Describe how you intend to develop the API module and provide the ability to run it in Web service mode

The API module (as well as the rest of the project) will be developed on our local machines using **GitHub** as a source control tool. Github was chosen as the source control to be used as it is formally required in the specification, but is also the most ubiquitous and common source control within the industry. As such, there really wasn't much consideration of any other alternatives, since Github was required and provided everything we needed from the source control system.

In terms of the Github workflow being used, our team typically relies on a feature-based branch model. This involves setting up a new branch for each new major feature, so that development of different functionality is segregated and protected from bugs or broken code. Once the team members responsible for a particular feature believe it to be done, they will then open a pull request, and it will then get merged to the main branch once it has been checked over. Our team has found this to be a logical system that works for us, since all major features are separated to the best of their ability and can be developed concurrently.

We have also chosen to use **DigitalOcean** to host the API for the web service mode. The main reason for this choice is the fact that our team has $50 worth of credit free for DigitalOcean included within our Github Student pack, and as a result makes this a very cost-effective solution for us. This is especially important since our team are all full-time university students, and thus do not have the budget to spend on an expensive hosting solution. Another reason for this choice is the ease and simplicity of use that DigitalOcean offers. Compared to a similar cloud hosting service such as **AWS** or **Microsoft Azure**, Digital Ocean seems to be much easier to get started with and has a much smoother learning curve. This point is particularly important, since no one in the group has had significant experience with web hosting on cloud-based services.


### 2. Discuss your	current thinking about how parameters can be passed to your module and how results are collected. Show an example of a possible interaction.

#### API Endpoints
*List all reports*
- **[<code>GET</code> reports](https://github.com/unsw-se3011/SENG3011_weneedREST/blob/documentation/Reports/Design%20Details/GET_reports.md)**
This endpoint was included for completeness, since the team felt like having the option to fetch all available reports might be a useful feature for some types of users, as well as for testing purposes. Although the user has the option of finding the reports they want using the specific search, this search will allow users to get the entire report base and then manually filter from there.

*Find all reports matching the query values*
- **[<code>GET</code> reports?{location}&{key_terms}&{date}](https://github.com/unsw-se3011/SENG3011_weneedREST/blob/documentation/Reports/Design%20Details/GET_reports_query.md)**
This endpoint is necessary for the site, since the main purpose is to allow users to search for reports by different fields. This endpoint allows more granular control over the record fetching, since the user is able to fetch records that match certain criteria, therefore only giving them a subset of the entire records available. This was the most important function to be included in the API, since it was key in the specification.

*Deletes a report*
- **[<code>DELETE</code> reports/\{id\}](https://github.com/unsw-se3011/SENG3011_weneedREST/blob/documentation/Reports/Design%20Details/DELETE_reports.md)**
Deleting a report was a feature that the team has added for the sake of completeness. This function simply allows for easy deletion of reports in the collection, and will be mainly used for testing.

*Updates an existing report with form data*
- **[<code>POST</code> reports/\{id\}](https://github.com/unsw-se3011/SENG3011_weneedREST/blob/documentation/Reports/Design%20Details/POST_reports.md)**
Similarly to the deletion function, the post endpoint was added for completeness. Mainly to be used for testing, this function also makes updating form data much simpler.

*Updates an existing report*
- **[<code>PUT</code> reports/\{id\}](https://github.com/unsw-se3011/SENG3011_weneedREST/blob/documentation/Reports/Design%20Details/PUT_reports.md)**
Again, added for sake of completeness. Allows for easy posting of reports into the collection for both testing and ease-of-use.

Notes (remove later):
* Justify every api endpoint and explain its use

### 3. Present and justify implementation	language,	development	and	deployment environment (e.g. Linux,	Windows) and specific	libraries	that you plan to use.

#### Implementation language

* **Flask-Restplus** is a lightweight, **Python** web framework that offers the same minimalistic canvas more suited towards a contained web API that we are designing. It is very simple to use with its fast debugger and offers a comprehensive set of documentation and example code. Furthermore, the amount of time needed for the project is short and the team is experienced with using Flask so less time is spent learning. Flask-Restplus offers automatic swagger API documentation.

* **React** has been used for the front-end of the application due to its speed and flexibility. React is able to integrate APIs directly into the front-end, which simplifies the development of our application significantly. React is also extremely well documented, which has allowed our team to pick up this relatively new technology quite quickly and be able to use itâ€™s many benefits within our development.

#### Development and deployment environment

* For our development environment, we have chosen to use a combination of **Mac** and **Linux**. This choice was fairly easy, because this was simply the machines that the team was using as their personal machines. All the development technologies and technologies within our stack were compatible witht eh machines being used, so we saw no reason to change this arrangement.

* We are aiming for the deployment environment to be platform-agnostic, and thus be compatible with all operating systems and browsers. This will therefore need to be tested before final deployment begins.

* For storage of the outbreak data, we have chosen to use a **JSON** file instead of storing the data in a database. The main reason for this decision was our groups fairly limited knowledge of databases, which would increase the development time and learning curve without necessarily providing any tangible benefits to our API. This was also recommended by our mentor. As a result, the web scraper will be run manually at a specified interval, with the outbreak data being stored in a JSON file which is subsequently accessed by the API.

#### Specific libraries used

* The **Python Scrapy library** was used for the initial web scraping application. Scrapy allowed us to quickly and easily set up the web scraper that we used to scrape information from the Global Incident Map website. Since this was only the initial part of our task, it was decided to use this this library in order to avoid us having to spend more time creating it. Scrapy is also a well documented and widely used library that is publically available, which made development significantly easier.
