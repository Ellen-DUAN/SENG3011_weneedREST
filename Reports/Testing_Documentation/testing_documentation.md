## Technologies used within testing (Testing environment, tools and limitations)

- **Postman** was the environment the team decided to use for testing. Postman is a collaborative API testing and development environment, and was suggested to us for use by our Mentor. Upon research of the application, it seemed to perfectly suit our requirements for what we needed the application for. Postman allows the team to work cooperatively to write tests for the API, and all the tests and outputs for the API are contained in a single workspace. Another alternative we were considering was **SoapUI** which has most of the same functionality as Postman, however Postman appeared to be the easier to use of the two, having a smaller, more focused set of features that better suited our project and it's timeline. The team has been very happy with Postman so far, and it has integrated well into our workflow and project.
