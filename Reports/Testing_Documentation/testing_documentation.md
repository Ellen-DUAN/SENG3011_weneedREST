## Testing process

## Technologies used within testing (Testing environment, tools and limitations)

- **Postman** was the environment the team decided to use for testing. Postman is a collaborative API testing and development environment, and was suggested to us for use by our Mentor. Upon research of the application, it seemed to perfectly suit our requirements for what we needed the application for. Postman allows the team to work cooperatively to write tests for the API, and all the tests and outputs for the API are contained in a single workspace. Another alternative we were considering was **SoapUI** which has most of the same functionality as Postman, however Postman appeared to be the easier to use of the two, having a smaller, more focused set of features that better suited our project and it's timeline. The team has been very happy with Postman so far, and it has integrated well into our workflow and project.

## Overview of test cases, testing data and testing results



TODO:
API Testing
• Describe the testing processes used in the development of API, referring to the data and scripts included in Phase_1 folder. This should describe your testing environment and/or tools used, and limitations (e.g. things that are not tested). Describe your testing process i.e. how your team conducts testing using the test data (e.g. in which order) and an overview of test cases, testing data and testing results.
• Describe the output of testing and what actions you took to improve the test results.

At D2 your Phase_1/TestScripts folder should contain:
1. Test input files
2. Test configuration files (if any)
3. Result files (if any)
4. Software or scripts used during testing (if any)

Platform Testing
• Describe the testing processes used in the development of the platform. You may include a sub-folder in Phase_2 folder to include any data, scripts you used to test the platform.
• Describe the output of testing and what actions you took to improve the test results.
